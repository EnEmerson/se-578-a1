## Submission requirements:

Make sure to follow the above-mentioned specifications for all assignments.

1. There should be one file named README.txt explaining which file contains what part of the
assignment and explaining the procedure to build your code. It should only be a .txt format. No
other format is acceptable.

2. Every subsequent file should contain the name of part of assignment it covers, so for example,
if the file contains the code for question 1, name the file Q1.c and so on.

3. Create a .zip or a .tar.gz of all the files that you submit and upload a single .zip or .tar.gz on
bblearn. The .zip or .tar.gz should be named as first letter of your first name and last name
followed by the assignment number. So, for example, for assignment 1, if your name is Jane
Doe, submit JDoe_hw1.zip or JDoe_hw1.tar.gz
